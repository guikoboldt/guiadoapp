This Repo was created to develop my final thesis in the university.

Given the current social and commercial crisis that the world is facing, 
which somehow will affect the future and how the market works, this article is 
supposed to help and promote the microentrepreneur, making the process to find 
them easy and valuing the local market. It is basically a new specific demand and 
supply of services platform, where the customers will be able to visualize the 
company/people “virtual business card”, with lots of information about the service 
provided (like business hour, location/address, service quality, average price, 
among other). Besides that, this proposed platform will offer some growth 
opportunities by providing real analytic data in a simple way, as well as creating 
a new way of looking for local products that are maybe closer than the customer 
expects.

The backend is developed in .Net Core with the most used patterns and standards that we have nowadays.
The frontend is developed in React (I am still getting into this React develpment and this project is to exercise it).
